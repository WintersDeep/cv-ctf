# CV CTF

_Because who doesn't want their CV to become a software project._

The repository contains documentation, code, and build tools used to produce the CTF I embed in my CV.

This is provided to help support discussions during interview (the CTF was originally _"closed source"_ but on more than one occasion it would have been useful to share). 

To check if the version of my CV you have is "current", genuine and/or unaltered; consult the [release history](./release-history.md), which includes the SHA256 hash of all released versions of the document.

If you have received a copy of my CV that does not include the CTF components and would like to receive a version with them, please email me using the address on the CV.
