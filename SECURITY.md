# Security Policy

The content of this repository is not intended for public distribution or usage. As such a security policy has not had any real substance put into it.

However I personally get irked when you find something you can't get fixed; with that in mind if you do feel the need to report something please raise it with me directly if you have my CV, or use <a href="security@wintersdeep.com?subject=CV-CTF">security@wintersdeep.com</a> if you do not.

Many thanks.
