# Flag #4: The only problem is I forgot to note down the password

There is no walkthrough for this flag - I want anyone giving me the final flag to have done some _"leg work"_.

However there is a design page, hints, and ultimately source code. Note that you won't find the final flag in the source (its part of a configuration file not kept in version control), but you can see exactly how the binary works to protect it and can use that knowledge as a "map" to your copy of the binary.

At the end of the design page I also give some pretty specific suggestions as to what a solution to this flag might look like.
