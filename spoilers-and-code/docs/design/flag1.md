# Flag #1: Got too close to sensative information.

A simple flag that I wanted pretty much anyone to get. PDF documents are vector file formats which means you can layer objects on top of each other. Data on lower "layers" still exists and can often still be interacted with.

The flag is written in plain-text under a "redacted" graphic. 

The whole problem here is finding it; and there are a number of statergies for that. The hint about recruiters finding this is designed to hint that alternative representations of the document tend to spill this secret (I've had one recuiter doing text extraction for keyword analysis and finding it this way). 

Its designed to immitate a number of "blunders" by various entities who have attempted to release documents with redacted information by drawing black boxes over sensative area's (akin to how you might with a black permanent marker).

## Considerations / Other Ideas / Suggestions

- **Placing the text "off canvas"** - whilst possible I felt this reduced accessibility of the flag and could mean requiring external tools to extract it. It would also make hinting to its location a little harder. I wanted the first flag to be easy and something you can almost stumble over.
