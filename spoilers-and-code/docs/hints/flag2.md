# Flag #2: I did a better job removing this one.

This document containers hints for the second flag. 

Its here to give some extra nudges if your trying to complete the CTF yourself but get a little lost or stuck.

<details>
<summary><strong>Hint 1/3</strong></summary>

This flag is not in the document as you see it; you will not find it by just hunting around the content.

<details>
<summary><strong>Hint 2/3</strong></summary>

You will also not find this flag via strings; its not an editing mistake like the previous flag.

<details>
<summary><strong>Hint 3/3</strong></summary>

Saving PDF's does not always work the way you think it works.
