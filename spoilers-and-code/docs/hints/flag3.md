<summary><strong>Hint 1/3</strong></summary>

The next flag is literally in the treasure. If you've noticed that you are probably on the right track.

<summary><strong>Hint 2/3</strong></summary>

If you've tried to get the treasure and not found anything, it might be how you went about getting it. It has a habit of vanishing if not approached carefully and specifically.

<summary><strong>Hint 3/3</strong></summary>

If you've not worked out that the next flag is in the treasure chest image, here is me explictly telling you its in the treasure chest image. 

Getting it out needs some care though and isn't as straight forward as you might think.
